This is a novel type of amm.
It has has a spot pool and when a proposal is created a set proportion of the liqudity is taken out of there and put into the conditional liqudiity. This proportion is a dao config, but has to be between 10 and 90%.

The conditinal markets a quantum hanson style liqudiity and coins.

So 1 spot USDC deposited goes to 1 USDC for each of the N outcomes.

When think about this system while a propsoal is live always model it an N conditional outcomes and n conditional outcomes.

Only on conditional outcome can win.
