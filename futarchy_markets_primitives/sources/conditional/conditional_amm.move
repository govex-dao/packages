// === Introduction ===
// This is a Uniswap V2-style XY=K AMM implementation for futarchy prediction markets.
//
// === Live-Flow Model Architecture ===
// This AMM is part of the "live-flow" liquidity model which allows dynamic liquidity
// management even while proposals are active. Key features:
//
// 1. **No Liquidity Locking**: Unlike traditional prediction markets, liquidity providers
//    can add or remove liquidity at any time, even during active proposals.
//
// 2. **Conditional Token Pools**: Each AMM pool trades conditional tokens (not spot tokens)
//    for a specific outcome. This allows the spot pool to remain liquid.
//
// 3. **Proportional Liquidity**: When LPs add/remove from the spot pool during active
//    proposals, liquidity is proportionally distributed/collected across all outcome AMMs.
//
// 4. **LP Token Architecture**: Each AMM pool has its own LP token type, but in the live-flow
//    model, these are managed internally. LPs only receive spot pool LP tokens.
//
// The flow works as follows:
// - Add liquidity: Spot tokens → Mint conditional tokens → Distribute to AMMs
// - Remove liquidity: Collect from AMMs → Redeem conditional tokens → Return spot tokens

// === Errors ===
const ELowLiquidity: u64 = 0; // Pool liquidity below minimum threshold
const EPoolEmpty: u64 = 1; // Attempting to swap/remove from empty pool
const EExcessiveSlippage: u64 = 2; // Output amount less than minimum specified
const EDivByZero: u64 = 3; // Division by zero in calculations
const EZeroLiquidity: u64 = 4; // Pool has zero liquidity
const EPriceTooHigh: u64 = 5; // Price exceeds maximum allowed value
const EZeroAmount: u64 = 6; // Input amount is zero
const EMarketIdMismatch: u64 = 7; // Market ID doesn't match expected value
const EInsufficientLPTokens: u64 = 8; // Not enough LP tokens to burn
const EInvalidTokenType: u64 = 9; // Wrong conditional token type provided
const EOverflow: u64 = 10; // Arithmetic overflow detected
const EInvalidFeeRate: u64 = 11; // Fee rate is invalid (e.g., >= 100%)
const EKInvariantViolation: u64 = 12; // K-invariant violation (guards constant-product invariant)
const EImbalancedLiquidity: u64 = 13; // Liquidity deposit is too imbalanced (>1% difference)

// === Constants ===
const FEE_SCALE: u64 = 10000;
const DEFAULT_FEE: u64 = 30; // 0.3%
const MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY: u128 = 1000;
// Other constants moved to constants module
